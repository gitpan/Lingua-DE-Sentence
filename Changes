		remove chr(150), which is a dash in evil window character setting as leading character, too
		of course, every good webmaster would use a &ndash;, but a good webmaster would'nt use windows, too :-)

		README - File added

		instead of a simple using locale,
		I use the POSIX module and try to set locale de_DE for the time of the routine get_sentences

		the methods
		set_acronyms, add_acronyms, get_acronyms, set_file_extensions, get_file_extensions, add_file_extensions are implemented now

		the test is a functional one, now

		abbreviations before an empty line are sentence endings now

		Thanks a lot to Andreas Marcel Riechert

		fix "Selbst der 100. Punkt ist kein ..."
		expect that numbers ending on 00 are ordinal ones,
		except 1900,2000,2100 which ones are surely year numbers

		fix <<bla bla.>> sagte er

		used POSIX [:lower:] to find lowercase words internal

		words of only vocals are abbreviations, too.

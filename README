Lingua::DE::Sentence is a module for splitting german text into sentences.
The module recognizes many, many rules. 
For normal german texts, the results should be, what you expect.
It's implemented to run very fast.

This module tries to use a german locale setting.
It tries to set the locale on a POSIX OS to de_DE.
Neither on a non POSIX OS, neither you have installed german language locales,
the module won't function.

Look at the POD-Documentation for further, known BUGS.

You can it install in the usual way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
